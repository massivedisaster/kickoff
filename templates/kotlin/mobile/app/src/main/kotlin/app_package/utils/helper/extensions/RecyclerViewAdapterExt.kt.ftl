/**
 * notify visible items of changes, it is assumed that the not visible items do not need to be refreshed since
 * they will recreated upon scrolling
 *
 * in very rare ocasions we might want to notify the recyler of item changes without passing a new data set
 *
 * example: cards in list can be premium, have a premium icon showing and can only be accessed when user is premium
 * cards can be premium or not
 * user can be premium or not
 * when user premium state changes we should refresh the recyclerviewadapter state, but the data can still be the same
 * because each card data has the object the user is trying to access but not the user object or premium state
 * we can use this function to refresh the recyclerviewadapter data upon user premium state changes, for example, to show/hide
 * the premium icon or allow/disallow user access, etc
